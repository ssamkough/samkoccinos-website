    this isnt as big as music or movies, but we also have our own book club of
    sorts.
  </p>
  <p>here's the list of all books:</p>
  <ul>
    {
      BOOKS.reverse().map(({ title, picker, date_started }) => (
        <li>
          {title}
          <ul>
            <li>title: {title}</li>
            <li>picked by: {picker}</li>
            <li>date started: {date_started}</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

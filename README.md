## Running Locally 🐱‍👓

1. Clone [repository](https://github.com/ssamkough/samkoccinos-website) in the directory you'd like: `git clone https://github.com/ssamkough/samkoccinos-website`.
2. After cloning the repo, [download PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).
   - For Windows, go to the [windows downloads page](https://windows.php.net/download#php-7.4) and download the thread safe zip.
   - Extract the contents in whatever directory you want (I put mine in a folder called `C:\php`).
3. Set PHP as an environment variable.
   - Add wherever you put your php directory to the path (mine would be `C:\php`).
   - Restart terminal afterwards.
4. Open up terminal, cd to your project directory, run: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000`.
